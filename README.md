Mini-Game built in LC-3 Assembly Language

The .asm files outside the game folders were hw assignments leading up to the final project. 

Enter the game folder to view all the assembly files, sprite images, and sound effects required to build the game. The exe should work on windows systems, and the game should be playable. View the readme instructions within that folder for gameplay instructions.
